We can use assignment operator to assign value to the variable.

Eg:
x=10

We can combine asignment operator with some other operator to form compound assignment operator.

Eg: x+=10 ====> x = x+10


The following is the list of all possible compound assignment operators in Python

+=
-=
*=
/=
%=
//=
**= &=
|=
^=

>>=
<<=

Eg:

1) x=10

3) print(x) ==>30

Eg:

1) x=10

3) print(x) ==>0
